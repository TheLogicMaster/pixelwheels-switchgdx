## 0.23.0 - 2022-07-03

### Added

- The Country championship has a new track: Flood (#181).

- Pixel Wheels is now translated in:
    - Basque, thanks to Josu Igoa.
    - German, thanks to Christian Schr√∂tter.

- Added a new vehicle: the Miramar.

- Championships have their own icon now, instead of using the icon of their first track.

- Linux: the archive now includes an `install.sh` script. This script can be used to install the game and setup a launcher icon for it. It is still possible to run the game without installation, though.

- Linux: It's now possible to `make install` the game.

### Changed

- Languages are now selected from a dedicated screen instead of in a selector menu. This makes it easier to see all available languages, and faster to select one.

- The vehicle selection screen now looks nicer.

### Fixed

- Mines no longer look like they are floating when dropped in water.

- Skid-marks are no longer drawn on top of water.

- Fixed Polish translation not loading.

- Fixed crash when there is only one racer (only possible using developer options for now) (#209).

- It is now possible to translate championship, track and vehicle names (#168).

- The "Open log file folder" now works on Windows (#225).

### Developers

- Started using Changie to manage the CHANGELOG <https://changie.dev/guide/changelog/>.

- Track waypoints are now defined using a polyline instead of independent points.

- GdxPrinter logs now include a timestamp.
