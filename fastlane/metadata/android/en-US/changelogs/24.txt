The Country championship has a new track: Flood.

The game is now translated Basque and German.

A new vehicle has been added: the Miramar.

Championships now have their own icon now, instead of using the icon of their first track.

The vehicle selection screen now looks nicer.

Skid-marks are no longer drawn on top of water.

Fixed Polish translation not loading.
